# Downloading Data

Here we want to download data from Sweden's Gauge station network. We can do this
with the `smhi_vatten_data` function. But first we want to look at the available guage stations with the `smhi_vatten_inv` function.

```{r}
smhi_inv <- smhi_vatten_inv() #load inventory

head(smhi_inv) #look at inventory data
```

Here we see all the gauge stations and their associated information. For our study.
